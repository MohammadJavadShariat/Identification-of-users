# Identification-of-users
Enter your information and see if you are a member of the program
Hello! 
In this program, you enter your information such as gender, height, weight, and eye color, and then the program checks whether this information is exactly the same as the information of the predetermined persons, and if it is the same, it will tell you your name and If there is not one, it will tell you that your name and information are not available in the program.
In this program, try and except are used to fix bugs, so that if a letter is entered instead of a number in the height and weight fields, a message will be shown and the question will be asked again.
Thank you for your attention
